Have an idea for a new tutorial? We'd love to discuss it. Please share some info
to get the discussion started.

**What networking protocol would this tutorial address?**
List specific projects such as IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, Multiformats, etc.

**What will the user know how to do after completing this tutorial?**
Be specific, eg "Upload files using the JS IPFS file API"

**Describe the content of the tutorial.**
Describe the tutorial in more detail. Do you have ideas for the APIs or methods
to be taught, format to be used, or real-world examples to be included?

**What potential challenges do you forsee in building this tutorial?**
For example, does the format you have in mind not fit the current capabilities
of the site?

**Additional context (optional)**
Would this ProtoSchool tutorial fit into a broader initiative to reach a certain
user or use case? Did you get the idea because of a gap you saw while exploring
a current tutorial?

**Would you like to build this tutorial yourself?**
Do you have the time and skills to build this tutorial yourself, after some group
brainstorming, or do you hope that someone else might have the bandwidth to do so?
