Have an idea for a new workshop? We'd love to discuss it. Please share some info
to get the discussion started.

**What networking protocol would this workshop address?**
List specific projects such as IPFS, IPLD, libp2p, Multiformats, etc.

**What will the user know how to do after completing this workshop?**
Be specific, eg "Upload files using the JS IPFS file API"

**Describe the content of the workshop.**
Describe the workshop in more detail. Do you have ideas for the APIs or methods
to be taught, format to be used, or real-worldexamples to be included?

**What potential challenges do you forsee in building this workshop?**
For example, does the format you have in mind not fit the current capabilities
of the site? 

**Additional context (optional)**
Would this ProtoSchool workshop fit into a broader initiative to reach a certain
user or use case? Did you get the idea because of a gap you saw while exploring
a current workshop?

**Would you like to build this workshop yourself?**
Do you have the time and skills to build this lesson yourself, after some group
brainstorming, or do you hope that someone else might have the bandwidth to do so?
