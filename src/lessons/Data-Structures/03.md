# Merkle Trees!

A merkle tree, or simple "hash tree," is a tree data structure in which every node is hashed.

```
               +--------+
               |        |
     +---------+  root  +---------+
     |         |        |         |
     |         +----+---+         |
     |              |             |
+----v-----+  +-----v----+  +-----v----+
|          |  |          |  |          |
|  node A  |  |  node B  |  |  node C  |
|          |  |          |  |          |
+----------+  +-----+----+  +-----+----+
                    |             |
              +-----v----+  +-----v----+
              |          |  |          |
              |  node D  |  |  node E  +-------+
              |          |  |          |       |
              +----------+  +-----+----+       |
                                  |            |
                            +-----v----+  +----v-----+
                            |          |  |          |
                            |  node F  |  |  node G  |
                            |          |  |          |
                            +----------+  +----------+
```

In a merkle tree, pointers to other node's are by content address (hash).

This means that, in the graph above, `node E` contains a reference to the hash for `node F` and `node G`.  This means that the content address (hash) of `node E` is unique to a node containing those addresses.

As this tree above is built the final content address (hash) of the root node is unique to a
tree than contains every node all the way down this tree. If any data, in any node, were
to change even by a single byte, the hash of the node would change as would all the hashes
of all the parent nodes.

In case you haven't noticed, this means that as a programmer you'll always need to build these data structures backwards, from the leaf nodes on up to the root node.
