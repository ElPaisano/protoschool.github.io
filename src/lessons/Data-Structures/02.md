URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are the primary addresses we give each other for data on the centralized web (you know, that plain old web we're all used to). They make it possible for us to create links and connect data on the web, so they serve a valuable purpose. (The web would be pretty lousy without links!)

However, URLs are based on a location where the page data is stored, not on the contents of the resource stored there. This presents us with some problems.

If you give me a URL, such as `https://www.puppies.com/beagle.jpg`, I'm likely to
make some guesses based on my experience. I'll guess from the file extension that
the content at that location is a JPEG image and guess that it's a drawing or photo
of a beagle, but I can't verify this from the URL alone. There may very well be a photo of a chihuahua hiding at `beagle.jpg`, or even worse, an adorable kitty! Likewise, it's natural for me to assume that that file hosted at `puppies.com` is safer to open than one hosted at `evilhacker.com`, but I can't be sure of that either.

This uncertainty also works in reverse. If you show me a picture of an adorable puppy and tell me it's stored on the web, there's no way for me to guess the URL where it's located. I can neither determine the domain, which tells us who's hosting it, nor the filename.



URLs indicate the *authority* (the domain name) we should ask for the data. Even though the web is already decentralized, in that anyone can link to anyone else, the location-based references we use for those links require that the data itself be
centralized so that we can get it from an authority.

As you can see, since we can't verify what content resides at a particular URL and are dependent on authorities (and human kindess) to label things as they really are, it's easy for us to get tricked.

It's also easy for 42,000 people to store exactly the same photo of an adorable beagle, all on different domains and with different filenames. Let's face it, even on our own laptops most of us have accidentally saved that save document as `download.pdf` and `download(01).pdf` without realizing it, or saved iterations of
the same term paper over and over again with `v1` or `2018-12-18` added to the title. The web is a confusing mess of data that's saved multiple times at different URLs, and there's no easy way to tell which items are identical to each other.

There must be a better way!
