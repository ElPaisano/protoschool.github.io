Welcome to ProtoSchool!

Let's learn all about decentralized data-structures.

## What's a data-structure?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In programming, data-structures are everywhere. The way you organize data into variables in order to use them in programs involves any from dozens to millions of data-structures.

## What are "decentralized data-structures?"

Decentralized data-structures are collections of data-stuctures that are *linked* to one another. This allows one data-structure to be distributed over many different computers and protocols.

In that same way that any web page on the web can link to another web page on the web in a different location, decentralized data-structures enable a web of interlinked data.

## What is hashing?

Cryptographic hashing is the most important tool in the toolbox of decentralized data-structures.

Hashing takes data of any size and returns you a single fixed-size "hash" for that data. Anyone using the same algorithm with the same data will arrive at the same hash.
