One important feature of DAGs is the ability to link them together.

The way you express links in the `ipfs` DAG store is with the `CID` of
another node.

For example, if we wanted one node to have a link called "foo" pointed
to another CID, it might look like:

```javascript
{
  foo: new CID('z43AaGEvwdfzjrCZ3Sq7DKxdDHrwoaPQDtqF4jfdkNEVTiqGVFW')
}
```
