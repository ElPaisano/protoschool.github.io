One important feature of DAGs is the ability to link them together.

The way you express links in the `ipfs` DAG store is with an object with a
single `'/'` attribute pointed at the `CID` of another node.

For example, if we wanted one node to have a link called "foo" pointed
to another CID, it might look like:

```javascript
{
  foo: {'/': 'z43AaGEvwdfzjrCZ3Sq7DKxdDHrwoaPQDtqF4jfdkNEVTiqGVFW'}
}
```

In `js-ipfs` we tend to work with instances of `CID` from the `cids` module.
Links need to be expressed with a base encoded string, so to create the
structure above you might use:

```javascript
{
  foo: {'/': cid.toBaseEncodedString()}
}
```
