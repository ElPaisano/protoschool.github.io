Everything that is stored in IPFS has an associated CID. That CID is constructed by hashing the data itself. If the same hash and encoding is used, then the same data will result in the same CID. This means that as soon as you edit data and store it, it will have a new CID. The old data won’t be overridden; it’s still there.

Before modifying the code, please open the developer tools in your browser and submit the code. You’ll see the CIDs of the blog posts in the console. When you look at the console again after you’ve modified the code, you’ll see the CIDs have changed.

Another common thing in blogs is tagging. Let’s modify the blog posts again and add some tags.
