A single object can have many links to other nodes. To illustrate this, we are creating new nodes which could be used for a tag cloud.

Links don’t necessarily need to be the value of a field (we call those “named links”); they can also be in an array.

```javascript
{ links: [
    {'/': 'a-base-encoded-cid'},
    {'/': 'another-base-encoded-cid'}
  ]
}
```

This is perfect for our use case. Create a new node for the tags “outdoor” and “hobby.” The structure should look like this:

```javavscript
{
  tag: "name-of-the-tag",
  posts: [
    // links to the CIDs
  ]
}
```

Please note that arrays are order-dependent. This means that two arrays with the same links in a different order will get a different CID.
