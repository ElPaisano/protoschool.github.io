With every blog post linked together, we can return all of them with only the CID of the last.

The `prev` fields contains a link to the previous blog post. You can use that CID and the `ipfs.dag.get()` API to get the previous blog.

Note: the `ipfs.dag.get()` API returns an object with a `value` attribute which is the node you want. Also, **links will be binary encoded**, so if you want them to be CID instances you'll need to use the `cid` module.

```javascript
let cid = (await ipfs.dag.get(someCid)).value.linkName
```

This kind of traversal could be used to create an overview page that lists all blog posts.
