This exercise has some prepared code to get started faster. It resembles a blog. There are authors (Nat and Sam) and some blog posts about trees and computers. At the moment there’s no relation between them. Let’s update the blog posts so that they link to the author.

In the [basic lessons](#/basics/02), we learned that a link in IPFS is represented as an instannce of `CID`:

```javascript
const link = new CID('z43AaGEvwdfzjrCZ3Sq7DKxdDHrwoaPQDtqF4jfdkNEVTiqGVFW')
```
